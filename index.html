        <h3>Here’s some things that are coming on the horizon:</h3>
        <div class="homelist">
            <ol class="homelist">
                <li class="">Servers. Forte is still working very hard to figure out our server issues. We don’t have an
                    ETA
                    but things
                    should hopefully be getting better and better. This is taking up all development time on his end.
                </li>
                <li class="">Colorblind support. It’s something we’ve put off for way too long… We plan on adding other
                    identifiers for
                    players as well as certain color focused tasks (Like wires). This should also open the potential for
                    more
                    colors. In the past we couldn’t add more colors because it became too difficult to tell players
                    apart.
                </li>
                <li class="">Friends/Account System. This is something we’ve wanted to do for a long time but just
                    haven’t
                    been able to
                    tackle. For the health of the game going forward we’re going to sink our teeth in and figure it out!
                    This one
                    will definitely take some time.</li>

                <li class="">A new stage! It is still very early and we have only just begun designing the layout. The
                    theme
                    has been
                    settled on though! The next stage in Among Us is going to be a Henry Stickmin themed location!</li>
                <li class="">We have LOTS of other things planned too, we just need to prioritize and organize all our
                    plans. Stay tuned! asdasdasd</li>
